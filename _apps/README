# Container with SCIF Apps

1. First make sure you have installed Singularity 
   (http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-linux)

2. To generate a SCI-F app, you can start with a recipe (Singularity) and 
   use it to bootstrap a new container image:

      singularity create --size 2000 container.img
      sudo singularity bootstrap container.img Singularity

3. If you downloaded the zip from containers-ftw, you should be able to unzip
   it, create the container, and run the command above.

   unzip SingularityRecipe.scif.zip
   <build container>
